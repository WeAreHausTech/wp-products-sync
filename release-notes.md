## Release 2.0.3
- Feat: Implement support for multiple collections

## Release 2.0.2
- Feat: Implement a setting to enable soft deletion for taxonomies in WordPress. With this feature, taxonomies will be marked as soft-deleted rather than permanently removed, and a redirect will ensure that users are prevented from accessing pages associated with soft-deleted taxonomies.
- Feat: An admin options page has been created to manage settings and configure the mapping for taxonomies to sync.
